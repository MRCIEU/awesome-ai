## Concepts

### Neural Machine Translation - attention mechanisms

Visualizing A Neural Machine Translation Model (Mechanics of Seq2seq Models With Attention)

### Transformer

A model that uses attention to boost the speed with which these models can be trained

### Universal Transformers

The Universal Transformer is an extension to the Transformer models which combines the parallelizability and global receptive field of the Transformer model with the recurrent inductive bias of RNNs, which seems to be better suited to a range of algorithmic and natural language understanding sequence-to-sequence problems.

## node2vec

An algorithmic framework for learning useful representation from highly structured objects such as graphs.
